									<h2>Anthony's Retail Sales Dashboard</h2>
									<p>In this project, I used Power BI to optimize the sales performance for a US-based retail firm with a multistate presence, analysing their sales data to uncover the most profitable stores and the most profitable time of the year. Through interactive infographics and geospatial mapping, I effectively visualized each store's profitability, identifying top-performing locations and informing data-driven decisions to maximize revenue and enhance overall business strategy.</p>

									<h2>Titanic Survival Analysis</h2>
									<p>Utilising Microsoft Excel in this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic's tragic sinking on April 15, 1912, and created engaging infographics to illuminate the survival rates across various demographics. My visualisations revealed insightful patterns and trends in survivorship by gender, age group, embarkation point, and ticket class, providing a fresh perspective on this historic event. </p>
